gofunc
======

gofunc implements cursed functional-programming-inspired abstract data types in
Go using generics. I'm so sorry, Rob.

gofunc requires Go 1.18 or above. Go 1.18 is currently only available via the
`gotip` command:

    go install golang.org/dl/gotip@latest

# Installation

Please do not install this cursed module. [There are resources available to you
if you're having thoughts.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

# Usage

Please do not use this cursed module. If you want to stare into the void, you
can view the [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wwalexander/gofunc).
